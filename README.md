### Introduction: 
I wanted to visualize the campaign finances of the 2022 U.S. House of Representatives races. I wanted to see the finances by party and individual. I also wanted to be able to filter by state and district.

### Data/operation abstraction design:
I added a variable that indicated whether or not the candidate won their race. I also updated some of the candidates' parties as needed.

### Future work:
I want to color the bars on the "Candidate" dashboard by party. So far, I have not been able to add color by party while also only showing the top 5 candidates by receipts. I also want to try to visualize and compare the finances between the elected candidate and the main challenger candidate in each district.
